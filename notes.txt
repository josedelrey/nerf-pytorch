Remaining NeRF implementations:
- Hierarchical sampling
- Details in the original NeRF implementation such as adding noise to the inputs

TODO:
- Implement other models:
    + Implement GaborNet
    + Implement KiloNeRF
    + Implement FastNeRF
    + Implement PlenOctrees
    + Implement Instant NGP
    + Implement Plenoxels

TODO Today:
- Improve convergence by sampling rays from a general ray pool
- Implement early stopping if overfitting based in validation set
- Research the use of FP16 for NeRF so it improves performance
